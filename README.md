## Features

- Pre-configured PyQt5 project structure.
- MVC architectural pattern implementation.
- Example code demonstrating how to use PyQt5 widgets and signals.
- Easy-to-follow documentation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your PyQt5 MVC project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SihabSahariar/PyQt5-MVC-Template.git
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
  Make sure you have PyQt5 installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```
